# Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

This project is a collaboration with Dr. Lauren Micalizzi from the Department Behavioral and Social Sciences. Exposure to smoking during pregnancy (SDP) and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) are two of the most ubiquitous and hazardous of childrenâ€™s environmental exposures. Seven to 15% of infants born per year are exposed to SDP and more than 25% of children are exposed to household ETS. SDP alone imposes a $4 billion annual economic burden due to health-care costs. Early smoke-exposure increases rates of externalizing behaviors in children, including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, and rates of substance use problems, all of which have clear public health implications. Early smoke exposure is also linked to self-regulation problems (i.e., the maintenance of physiological, emotional, behavioral, and cognitive control).

### preprocessing.R
Contains the preprocessing steps necessary for exploratory data analysis. Specifically, this script filters for data collected at baseline and it reduces the number of variables from 1,282 to 78 by dropping or summarizing variables. 

### project1_EDA.Rmd
The Rmarkdown version of the Exploratory Data Analysis report, which includes both written text interpretations and raw code used in the analysis. 

### project1_EDA.pdf
The PDF version of the Exploratory Data Analysis report, which includes both written text interpretations and a Code Applendix with the raw code used in the analysis.
