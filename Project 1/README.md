# Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

Exposure to smoking during pregnancy and environmental tobacco smoke are two of the most ubiquitous and hazardous of childrenâ€™s environmental exposures. Early smoke-exposure increases rates of externalizing behaviors in children, including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and rates of substance use problems, all of which have clear public health implications. Early smoke exposure is also linked to self-regulation problems (i.e., the maintenance of physiological, emotional, behavioral, and cognitive control). 

Around 15 years ago, approximately 800 pregnant people were recruited in a study that investigated whether a tailored video intervention reduced smoking and environmental tobacco exposure during and after pregnancy. The current study's sample is a subset of the mothers recruited in this previous study, along with their children who are now 12 to 16 years old. The study aims to examine the association between prenatal and postnatal smoke exposure with the teenage children's substance use, self regulation, and externalizing behaviors. The study collected data during baseline, 6-month, and 12-month laboratory sessions, though this exploratory analysis report uses only the baseline data. The children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors were measured using computerized assessments completed by both the mothers and the children themselves.
